static classes, method and variable can be created.

static block - initialize static variables
instance block - initialize instance variables
static->instance->constructor execution path.
constructors are at instance level.

static variables can be accessed anywhere but instance variable can not be accessed in the static block.

maintain your errors.

in class - variables
	   methods
	   constructors
	   static block
	   instance block

I i define a method with more names and different parameters called as method overloading.
And same for the constructor.

polymorphism - same name different parameters, compile time polymorphism, static binding.
when parameter_names and instance variable names are same use this keyword.

selection - 
if-else
switch - case and default both are optional.
